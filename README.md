## General Information

### Leetcode 

In general, leetcode interview questions draw from data structures, algorithms, and introductory programming knowledge. Specific topics include linked lists, stacks, heaps and priority queues, hash map, graph, BFS, DFS, tree, BT, BTS, sorting methods, dynamic programming, binary search, and recursion. Some undergraduate CS courses that teach you these topics include CSC148, CSC165, CSC236, CSC263, CSC373. You do not need to wait to take these courses to learn about these topics, as there are many online resources (including practicing leetcode questions). Linked below are some resources for you:

### Behavioural Questions

Some questions that you should always prepare for are ‘Tell me why you want to work here.’ , ‘What excites you about the company?’, ‘Can you tell me a bit about what you know about the company?’. In addition to reviewing your own resume, it is very important that you do research on your interviewer and their current work, and the company, their recent projects, and which projects you find most interesting. Linked below are some resources to help you prepare for the behavioral question portion of the interview. 

- [Common behavioral questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview-questions/)
- [10 important behavioral questions](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/software-engineer-behavioral-interview-questions)

When it comes to answering behavioral questions, don’t stress! If you thoroughly reviewed your resume, and conducted sufficient research on your interviewee and the company you are interviewing for, your answers should come naturally.

## MAANG and Large Companies
Whenever someone mentions tech, it's usually these companies that first come to mind. MAANG which stands for Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google are amongst the biggest names in the technology industry. Employing a couple thousand people across the globe, these companies usually have revenues in the billions. Typically, roles are not flexible, you work on a very small part of the whole and hours can be long. The major draws to work at these companies are usually the brand value and the compensation.

#### Apple: https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1734481/apple-top-100-questions
#### Amazon: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-amazon-questions/
#### Google: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-google-questions/


### Specific Behavioural Questions

In addition to the general behavioral questions. Many of these companies have "guiding principles" and seek employees that embody these principles. They often stucture their behavioural questions to try and see if you exhibit these values. 

For example, Amazon has their [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles) and Meta has their [Core Values](https://www.metacareers.com/facebook-life/). It is a very good idea to go through each of these values and come up with stories/answers that showcase how you embody them.

### Salary:
The compensation stucture for these companies usually involves 3 components: 
1. A base salary: ~ $100k - 120k
2. Signing bonus (for first 1-2 years): ~$20k - 40k
3. Stocks (with varying vesting schedules): ~ 100k

Total/year : ~ $140k - $180k

Usually have comprehensive benefits in terms of health insurance, relocation stipends etc. 

### Hiring process
The hiring process for these companies typically involves 3-5 rounds. The first round is usually an online assessment with 2-3 leetcode questions of varying difficulty. The next couple rounds will be any combination of phone screens, behavioural interviews, work place simulations or technical interviews. These companies often change their interview process, checking forums like reddit, glassdoor, youtube etc. is a good way to get a clue as to what the next steps might be, the company themselves usually also provide you with comprehensive information for each step of the process. 

### Work Culture
Given the competitive nature of these jobs, long hours are not uncommon. That said, considering how large these companies are, there is never a one shoe fits all, and the "work culture" is very team/manager dependant. Your individual work is usually a small part of the whole and as an entry level SDE, you will not usually have too much say in bigger picture stuff. 

## Small and Medium Sized Companies

Mid/small sized tech companies typically employ 50 - 250 people and generate a revenue of $10 million to $1 billion. There are many benefits to working at a midsize company including a typically flexible schedule and work life balance and the ability to re-invent and measure the impact of your work as the company grows. Similar to start-ups you might also have the opportunity to work with the full technical stack and learn it inside out. 

### Specific Leetcode Questions

Depending on the company you are interviewing for you may or may not be asked to solve leetcode questions. Just in case, it is recommended that you practice some leetcode questions. Linked below are some resources for you to use:

### Specific Behavioural Questions

The behavioral questions you will be asked in your interview will be similar to those asked for larger companies and start-ups. In general, interviews for small and medium sized companies are more personal and less structured than larger companies. 

### Salary

The average hourly wage of a software engineering intern at a small/medium sized company is around $25/hour or $4000/month. Some companies will also offer you a sign on bonus of around $1000 to $2000. Small/medium sized companies do not have extensive benefits for their interns, and depending on the company you are working for you may or may not be paid for vacation days. 

### Hiring process

The hiring process for small/medium tech companies is similar to that of large tech companies. After applying/networking you may receive an email inviting you for an interview. The primary interview is typically a more behavioral question based interview that lasts around 30 minutes. If you are successful with the first interview you may be invited back for a second more technical interview. In this interview the interviewer may ask you a question and ask you to step through a solution verbally, they may ask you to solve a leetcode question, or they might ask you to share your screen and write some basic code. Now depending on the company they may even conduct a third interview. This typically occurs if the company is trying to decide between multiple candidates. This interview could then be tailored to compare the candidates so they can make their final decision. 

### Work Culture

From a variety of sources, and personal experience, working at a small/medium sized company provides a good workplace culture and work life balance. With a maximum of a few hundred employees, while working in a small/medium sized company you will have more insight into the work being done at the various levels of staff. It will be easier to interact with your leaders and decision makers and thus you will not feel like just a number. Work will feel more like a small community.
